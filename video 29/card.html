            <p>Lake is a large body of water surrounded by land. Lakes are inland and not part of the ocean, and they are
                usually freshwater. Lakes can be formed in many ways, such as by glaciers, tectonic activity, or volcanic
                activity. They can also be created by human activities, such as damming rivers or excavating land.</p>
